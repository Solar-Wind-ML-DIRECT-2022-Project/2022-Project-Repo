###  **Component List**  <br><br>

**Component 1**<br>
Name: User interface <br>
What it does: Thats the input to feed into the trained algorithm to yield the desired outputs (economic data, solar resource forecast).<br>
Inputs: Geographic location, years of interest.<br>
Outputs: economic data, solar resource forecast.<br><br>

**Component 2**<br>
Name: Trained ML model <br>
What it does: Models future solar resource and economic data using current weather trends using machine learning. <br>
Inputs: Solar irradiance, temperature, economic data of renewable energy based off on index values, location, dates, and other features of interest. <br>
Outputs: A trained model that can use the inputs of component 1 to predict the outputs.
