# SERF: Solar Energy Resource Forecasting
## Motivation
Transitioning to renewable energy resources is key to mitigating the effects of climate change. 
For companies and individuals interested in switching to renewable energy resources, it is important to know whether those resources will be reliable in the future. In this package, weâ€™ve forecasted the solar resource (i.e. solar irradiance) based upon prior historical data for the purpose of understanding how solar irradiance may change over time and which locations across Washington State are optimal for said resource. This model may be used for other locations and for forecasting other renewable energy resources if so desired in the future. 

## Methods
A commonly used statistical method for time series forecasting is the ARIMA model.
Autoregressive integrated moving average, or ARIMA, Utilizes lagged values (autoregressive) of a target variable to make a prediction based on trends (integrated). The model also takes lagged prediction errors as inputs (moving average) to improve prediction accuracy.

This program utilizes SARIMA (seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average) which is an extension of the statistical prediction approach ARIMA. SARIMA handles univariate time series data with seasonal variations. For this package, the model takes in historical irradiance data for specific geolocations in a confined geographical region. and predicts future irradiance data for each of the geolocations. The prediction data for each of the locations is then used to provide estimates (based on a linear surface fit) for locations that lie between the known locations.
