This document will function as our explanation of use cases.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use case 1: Individual Home Owner <br>
What it does: Forecasts solar resource for several years or more into the future based on prior weather/climate data. A very easy, user friendly interface would be most desirable for this user. Ideally, economic information for various types of solar panel installations could be calculated on top of the solar resource forecasting. <br>
Inputs: Location of the home <br>
Outputs: (1) Confidence interval solar resource forecast estimate for many future years [<W/m^2>] (2) Economic data for solar cells based on the solar resource CI (i.e., net present value CI) <br>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use case 2: Large Utility Company / Government Sponsored Utility Installation <br>
What it does: Forecasts solar resource for several years or more into the future based on prior weather/climate data for a variety of locations of interest. This imagined utility company is set to install a solar plant but has several locations in a broad geographic area to choose from. Thus, the model would aim to provide information as to what would be the best location for this utility company to install such a plant. <br>
Inputs: Locations of interest for solar plant installation <br>
Outputs: (1) Confidence interval solar resource forecast estimate for many future years [<W/m^2>] (2) Economic data for plant installation at each location based on CI (i.e., net present value CI) (3) Output a comparison of each location for benefits and drawbacks  <br>
